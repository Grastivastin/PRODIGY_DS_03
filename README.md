# Task 03 – Decision Tree Classifier

## Objective
To build and evaluate a Decision Tree classification model using the Titanic dataset
to predict passenger survival.

## Dataset
- Titanic Dataset (loaded using Seaborn)
- Includes passenger details such as age, gender, class, fare, and survival status

## Methodology
- Loaded the dataset using Seaborn
- Performed basic data cleaning and preprocessing
- Handled missing values in numerical and categorical features
- Encoded categorical variables into numerical format
- Split the data into training and testing sets
- Trained a Decision Tree Classifier
- Evaluated the model using accuracy and classification report

## Machine Learning Model
- Algorithm: Decision Tree Classifier
- Type: Supervised Learning (Classification)

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab

## Results
- The model achieved reasonable accuracy on the test dataset
- Gender, passenger class, and age were important factors in predicting survival

## Conclusion
The Decision Tree model successfully demonstrated how supervised machine learning
can be applied to real-world data. This task highlights the complete ML workflow
from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
