# Task 03 – Decision Tree Classifier

## Objective
To build and evaluate a Decision Tree classification model that predicts
passenger survival using the Titanic dataset.

## Dataset
- Titanic Dataset (loaded using Seaborn)
- Contains passenger information such as age, gender, class, fare, and survival status

## Methodology
- Loaded the dataset using Seaborn
- Performed data cleaning and preprocessing
- Handled missing values in numerical and categorical features
- Removed irrelevant columns
- Encoded categorical variables into numerical format
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets
- Trained a Decision Tree Classifier
- Evaluated the model using accuracy and classification report

## Machine Learning Model
- Algorithm: Decision Tree Classifier
- Learning Type: Supervised Learning (Classification)

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab

## Results
- The model achieved reasonable accuracy on the test dataset
- Features such as gender, passenger class, and age significantly influenced survival predictions

## Conclusion
The Decision Tree classifier successfully demonstrated the application of
supervised machine learning on a real-world dataset. This task highlights the
complete workflow from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
